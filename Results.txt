The central limit theorem states that arithmetic mean of large number of independent random samples will be normally distributed.

To illustrate this using bootstrap, we have taken 4 examples. The 1st 2 examples are for 2 random normal distribution. 

Normal distribution
==================
For the 1st example we take a random distribution of 50 with mean = 10 & sd =3.
The mean of this sample = 10.26382 
When we use bootstrap and generate 1000 sample for then and obtain a mean of those sample means, we see that the mean of these samplemeans = 10.28866. 
Also the histogram of the means shows that a normal distribution
The same holds good for the 2nd example of 100 with mean = 23 & sd = 5

Exponential distribution
==================
For the 1st example we take a random exponetial distribution of 50.
The mean of this sample = 1.122936 
When we use bootstrap and generate 1000 sample for then and obtain a mean of those sample means, we see that the mean of these samplemeans = 1.116781. 
Also the histogram of the means shows that a normal distribution
